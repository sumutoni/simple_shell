##Simple Shell
This project builds a simple shell similar to sh in C.
A shell is a program that relays user commands to the operating system to be executed.

Many linux distributions come with Bourne-Again shell(bash) and/or sh with them. This project is
our own interpretation of a simple shell. Our shell will be so simple that it won't handle pipes
and redirections.
